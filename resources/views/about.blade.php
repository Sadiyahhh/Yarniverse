                Yarniverse is more than a crafting project planner; it's a hub where inspiration meets innovation, and where

                creativity and aim to provide a digital haven where crocheters of all levels can collaborate, share, and celebrate 
                their craft.</p>

        <h2>The First Stitch</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2023, Yarniverse was formed with the intention of combining e-commerce with an online project 
            management tool for crafty lovers everywhere. We appreciate the difficulty faced with keeping on top of 
            your crochet projects, so our project management tools are a great way to keep on top of things.
